## How It's Made

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the web application.
- **CSS:** Styles the user interface and plays a crucial role in positioning a video as a background for the page.
- **JavaScript:** Collects the user's birthdate input and returns their zodiac sign with additional information.

One of the major challenges I faced was making the video a background for the page. This required a deep understanding of CSS properties like `z-index` and `position: fixed`, which I successfully implemented.

## Optimizations (Planned) 🛠️

Coming soon! Here's an optimization planned for the future:

- Converting the video background into a more memory-efficient GIF format to improve overall performance.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀

## Lessons Learned 📚

During the development of this project, I gained valuable insights:

- I learned about the use of `z-index` and its use cases in creating engaging background effects.
- I discovered that using the `playsinline` attribute in HTML video tags can help with autoplay functionality on mobile devices.
